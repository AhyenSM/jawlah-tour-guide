2. Interactive Game (Deployable for Free, Uses Twine or React-Based Game Framework)
Game Concept:
•	Theme: A guided tour simulation of Qatar where users make choices as a tourist navigating the city.
•	Objective: Players interact with realistic travel scenarios based on our interview questionnaire and earn a "Traveler Score."
•	Gameplay Mechanics:
o	Multiple-choice questions & scenario-based storytelling.
o	Challenges related to travel, history, and culture.
o	Point-based scoring system (gamified experience).
Example Scenarios (from Interview Questionnaire):
1.	"You just landed in Doha. Do you hire a private guide, join a group, or explore solo?"
2.	"Your guide offers you a traditional Qatari meal. Do you try it or stick to what you know?"
3.	"You’re booking a desert safari, but it’s peak time. Do you pay a premium for a priority slot or wait?"
Game Implementation:
•	React-based interactive storytelling game OR a Twine-based branching narrative (free & deployable).
•	User selections stored (if using React, data logged in local storage).
•	End of the game: Players get a Traveler Score + optional signup for Jawlah early access.

Final Notes:
•	The landing page + game should be 100% freely deployable (on Replit or Netlify).
•	The game integrates seamlessly with the landing page (either embedded or linked).
•	The Jotform AI chatbot is included for user engagement.
•	Ensure mobile responsiveness for both the landing page & game.
